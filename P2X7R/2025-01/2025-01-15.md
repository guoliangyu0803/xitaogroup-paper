IntroductionThe case analysis method is widely used in evaluating dolphin assisted activities due to the lack of research participants. Despite other present diagnostic features adults with major depressive disorder experience psychomotor changes, dysphoria, anhedonia, impaired concentration, and suicidal thoughts. Increasing studies assess the positive effect of proprioceptive exercises in various depressive cases.Methods14 adults diagnosed major depressive disorder included in this case study between September 2022 to April 2024. A two-week proprioceptive dolphin assisted activity program was applied for each with a two-day break after half applied activities, in total 10 activities for each were organised. Proprioceptive dolphin assisted activities varied from heavy muscle work to muscles and joints pressure which was held in a special therapeutic pool, where adults wore wetsuits. The SF—36 scale was used, with levels of QoL compared among: (a) before dolphin assisted activities, (b) after two-week proprioceptive dolphin assisted activities, (c) in a year after two-week proprioceptive dolphin assisted activities. The MyotonPro portable device was used for measuring muscle tension, biomechanical and viscoelastic properties each day of participation: (a) before dolphin assisted activities and (b) after dolphin assisted activities. The MyotonPro was applied to measure the upper (descending) part of the trapezius muscle, lateral part of the deltoids muscle, middle point of the flexor carpi radialis muscle, middle point of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle, the gastrocnemius muscle (plural gastrocnemii), and quadriceps femoris muscle.ResultsThe measuring results of SF—36 scale showed statistically significant changes in 5 subscales out of 8 (Friedman’s test p-value less than 0.05) and in one more scale a partially significant change (p < 0.1). The physical activity that increased after dolphin therapy (from 68.5 to 85) remained the same in one year. There were no statistically significant changes in role limitations due to physical health. However, role limitations due to emotional problems and partially significant changes were recorded, the situation slightly worsened a year later, but there was no statistically significant deterioration. The non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare two dependent samples measured by the MyotonPro. Although the improvement was recorded in almost all muscle groups, statistically significant changes were observed only in trapezius muscle md p right, measuring stiffness, relaxation and creep; trapezius md p left measuring frequency, stiffness, relaxation and decrement; and deltoids muscle left, measuring frequency, stiffness and relaxation, i.e., the p-values of Wilcoxon test are less than 0.05.ConclusionTwo-weeks of proprioceptive dolphin assisted activities for adults with major depression have statistically significant long-term change in better physical parameters. Emotional betterment parameters were less stable. The quick reactivity of trapezius muscle revealed that dolphin assisted activities acts as stress relief, and deltoids muscle as relief of negative emotions, such as fear and anger.

摘要 (中文): 由于缺乏研究参与者，案例分析方法被广泛用于评估海豚辅助活动。尽管存在其他诊断特征，但患有严重抑郁症的成年人会经历精神运动变化，烦躁不安，快感不足，注意力不集中和自杀念头。越来越多的研究评估了本体感觉运动在各种抑郁症病例中的积极作用。方法在2022年9月至2024年4月之间，本案例研究包括14名诊断为严重抑郁症的成年人。每个应用了为期两周的本体感受海豚辅助活动计划，在进行了一半的活动后休息两天，总共组织了10项活动。本体感受海豚的辅助活动从繁重的肌肉工作到肌肉和关节压力不等，这些活动都在一个特殊的治疗池中举行，成年人穿着潜水服。使用SF-36量表，比较以下人群的QoL水平 :( a) 在海豚辅助活动之前，(b) 在本体感受海豚辅助活动两周之后，(c) 在本体感受海豚辅助活动两周之后的一年内。MyotonPro便携式设备用于测量参与的每一天的肌肉张力，生物力学和粘弹性特性 :( a) 在海豚辅助活动之前和 (b) 在海豚辅助活动之后。应用MyotonPro测量斜方肌的上 (降) 部分，三角肌的外侧部分，radialis腕屈肌的中点，肱二头肌长头的中点，腓肠肌 (复数腓肠肌)，和股四头肌。结果SF-36量表的测量结果显示，8个量表中有5个分量表有统计学意义的变化 (弗里德曼测试一下p值小于0.05)，还有一个量表有部分显著变化 (p  &lt;  0.1)。海豚治疗后增加的身体活动 (从68.5增加到85) 在一年内保持不变。由于身体健康，角色限制没有统计学上的显着变化。但是，由于情绪问题和部分显着变化而导致的角色限制被记录下来，一年后情况略有恶化，但没有统计学上的显着恶化。非参数Wilcoxon测试一下用于比较通过MyotonPro测量的两个依赖性样品。尽管几乎所有肌肉组都记录了改善，但仅在斜方肌md p右测量刚度，松弛和蠕变中观察到统计学上的显着变化; 斜方肌md p左测量频率，刚度，松弛和衰减; 三角肌左测量频率，刚度和松弛，即，wilcoxon测试一下的p值小于0.05。结论2周的本体感受海豚辅助活动对成年抑郁症患者的身体参数有统计学意义的长期变化。情绪改善参数不太稳定。斜方肌的快速反应表明，海豚辅助活动可以缓解压力，三角肌可以缓解恐惧和愤怒等负面情绪。

# The aftermath of multiple trauma on a nation: unraveling Lebanon’s unique mental health struggle

## 一个国家多重创伤的后果: 解开黎巴嫩独特的精神健康斗争

ObjectiveThis study examines the national prevalence of mental health disorders and their associated factors in Lebanon, specifically in the aftermath of the 2020 events, including the catastrophic events of Beirut blast and the concurrent financial meltdown amid the global pandemic.MethodsConducted between July and September 2022, the study interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,000 Lebanese via telephone, using the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. Gender-specific bivariate and multivariate models were generated for probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.ResultsHigh rates of mental health disorders emerged — 47.8% screened positive for probable depression, 45.3% for probable anxiety, and 43.5% met the probable diagnosis for PTSD. Multivariate gender-specific analyses revealed no significant associations with governorate, employment status, or marital status, while the financial composite score consistently influenced all disorders.ConclusionLebanon faces a severe mental health crisis, evidenced by elevated rates of probable depression, anxiety, and PTSD. The universal impact of multiple traumas transcends typical determinants, emphasizing the need for nuanced interventions and targeted policy considerations.

摘要 (中文): 目的本研究调查了黎巴嫩精神健康障碍的全国患病率及其相关因素，特别是在2020事件之后，包括贝鲁特爆炸的灾难性事件和全球大流行期间同时发生的金融危机。在7月和2022年9月之间进行的方法，该研究使用计算机辅助电话采访 (CATI) 系统，通过电话采访了1,000名黎巴嫩人的全国代表性样本。针对可能的创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD)，抑郁和焦虑产生了性别特定的双变量和多变量模型。结果出现了高比例的精神健康障碍-47.8% 筛查出可能的抑郁阳性，可能的焦虑45.3%，43.5% 符合PTSD的可能诊断。多变量性别分析显示，与省份、就业状况或婚姻状况没有显著关联，而财务综合评分一直影响所有疾病。结论黎巴嫩面临严重的精神健康危机，可能的抑郁、焦虑和创伤后应激障碍的发生率上升证明了这一点。多重创伤的普遍影响超越了典型的决定因素，强调需要细微的干预和有针对性的政策考虑。
